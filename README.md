> This entire repository is a working progress. Next up are some updates to the 'Geography.pckg' including rivers and mountains. Also, I'm working on some machine learning implementations which I want to put into flashcards as well.

## What is it?
This is a place to store and share [anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) about subjects I taught myself and consider worth remembering. Each *.apkg* contains a card deck about a certain subject. You will need to download the anki software to your pc or phone and import the *.apkg* files in order to access the content.


## Why did I do it?
I like to know things. This way of processing and reviewing knowledge has proven to help me remember information more efectively.


## What is in it?
### *Geography.apkg*
